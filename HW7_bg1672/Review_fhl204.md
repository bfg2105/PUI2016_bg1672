Plot Review by fhl204

Hi Bailey,

Excellent graph!  Just a few notes and suggestions below:  

CLARITY: The figure description below the chart clearly explained intent though I could hear the professor saying 
that it should also be accomplanied with a title.  Other standard labels are visible (x/y ticks, axis labels and 
legend) though they could be a tad bigger.  Increasing the number of axis ticks might also help with a light-colored grid.  
A brief explanation why you set the xmin and max accordingly would be helpful in the description.  

ESTHETIC: I like the colors and excellent use of white space.  Though the markers are a bit small, it works in this case 
because of the high volume.

HONESTY: It's interesting to see the station number on the x-axis. I see somewhat of an upward trend so I'm curious if 
the higher station numbers are in more densely populated/high traffic areas.  Also curious to look into why the male 
number of rides are so much higher in the higher station numbers.  Though it seems counter intuitive for the variable, 
station number, a regression line might be interesting to see here.

The graph has piqued my interest.  Great work!
