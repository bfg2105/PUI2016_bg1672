Homework 10

Assignment 1:
For Assignment 1, we had to complete Lab 9 that was given to us in class by guest lecturer, Sina Kashuk, PhD.  The 
lab explored strategies for determining spatial autocorrelation.  It is important o look for spatial autocorrelation 
in data in order to test the validity of statistical results.  A result might indicate a statistically significant relationship 
but this could be explained by the presence of a spatial autocorrelation.  Therefore, spatial autocorrelation should be 
considered when examining relationships between variables in datasets.  In this lab we explored spatial autocorrelation of 
mean rides for citibike stations.  The results indicated that there was a spatial correlation in some parts of the city.  
Midtown Manhattan had a strong spatial autocorrelation, with high mean rides clustered in that locality.  The outer neighborhoods
of Brooklyn had a high spatial autocorrelation as well, but with low mean rides clustered in those neighborhoods, perhaps due to 
there being fewer stations and potentially more car ownership.

Assignment 2:
For assignment 2, I worked with Celia Yu, Christian Rosado, and Dana Karwas. I suggested the method that we eventually used 
for filtering out the summer and winter datasets.  I also worked with Tyler Woebkenberg, Jonathan Geis, and Ben Alpert.  I used 
Scott Smith's suggestion and script for replacing zeroes with NaN, and taking the mean of the subsequent dataset to obtain the 
monthly means for the summer and winter.  Scott's reasoning was that taking the sum of the monthly rides would weight stations 
more heavily if they had been an origional station, and it would weight newer stations less heavily.
