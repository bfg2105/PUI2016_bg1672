Homework 11: Clustering and Using Geopandas to plot data on mapped polygons.

For this homework I worked with
	Sebastian Bana <sbg389@nyu.edu>,
  Benjamin Joseph Alpert <bja282@nyu.edu>,
  Luis Fernando Melchor Fernandez <lmf445@nyu.edu>,
  Sofiya Elyukin <se1296@nyu.edu>,
  Jonathan D Geis <jdg545@nyu.edu>,
  Tyler Woebkenberg <tw1574@nyu.edu>
	Scott Smith <ss4977@nyu.edu>

We mostly worked together and collaborated on solutions.  Scott gave helpful advice.
